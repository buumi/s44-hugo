Evidently two releases in two months wore us out for a whole year :)

We (the S44 devs) are incredibly pleased to release Spring:1944 v1.7 “Operation
Neptune”.

The main features in this release are a whole bunch of visual updates to our
ships, and a handful of new naval units — all of this through yuritch’s most
excellent work.

This release also includes a large number of bugfixes and updates for newer
Spring engine versions.

Have fun, see you on #s44 or the forums!
