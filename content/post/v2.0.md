Aaaand another one!

The Spring: 1944 team is overjoyed to bring you Spring: 1944 v2.0, Operation
Overlord!

This release includes all kinds of goodies, but the major features are two (!)
new factions: Japan and Italy. In addition, the naval game has been entirely
revamped â€” ships now have individually controllable/targetable turrets.

These days Spring lobbies will automatically download the game when you join
one of our hosts, so if you want to play, just grab Spring or Weblobby, join
the #s44 channel, and pop into one of our games.

Happy gaming, and hope to see you in #s44 :)

The S44 Team
